# Simple-Voice-Activation-Detector-VAD-
a VAD system, detects active part of a voice using some factors like energy or zero-crossing-rate.
In many speech signal processing applications, voice activity detection (VAD) plays an essential role for separating an
audio stream into time intervals that contain speech activity and time intervals where speech is absent.
One important aspect of designing a VAD algorithm is the selection of features that represent discriminative
properties of speech and noise.In this code we are going to calculate ZCR and Energy of signals.
